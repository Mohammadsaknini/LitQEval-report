\section{Structure of this work}\label{sec:structure}
The remainder of this work is structured as follows:

After this introduction we will first focus on foundations in \autoref{ch:foundations}, by briefly recapturing necessary basics / state of the art (\autoref{sec:basics}) and common metrics (\autoref{sec:metrics}) used for evaluations in the community, before describing previous related works in \autoref{sec:relwork}.

Afterwards, we will detail our approach in \autoref{ch:ownApproach} and its components as visualized in \autoref{fig:my_label}, consisting of ... (maybe a sentence each?)

We evaluate our approach in \autoref{ch:eval}, by first describing our experimental setup... (maybe a sentence each?)

We conclude this work with a summary, our main contributions and an outlook in \autoref{ch:conclusion}.

If easy to visualize, why not put an overview graphic here and reference it from text like this: \autoref{fig:my_label}?
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{FrontBackmatter/H-BRS_Logo_A4}
    \caption[Short Caption shown in list of figures.]{Caption such as: An overview of the different work components being developed in this Thesis. Notice how components 1 and 2 build the foundation for 3 and 4, while 5 is independent of them.

    If you can, include pictures as vectorized graphics / PDF. Keeps the file size low and they look much better.
    
    Never forget to cite a picture if it's copied / based on someone else's work, e.g., an explicit "(\IfLanguageName{ngerman}{Bildquelle / Bild in Anlehnung an}{Image source / Image adapted from}: \cite{DBLP:books/lib/Knuth97}.)" at the end of your caption.}

Also use \verb|\autoref{...}| instead of \verb|\ref{...}|, so you don't have to deal with prefixes and everything is consistent automagically.
