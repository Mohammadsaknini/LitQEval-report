  abstract = {Drones, also called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), have witnessed a remarkable development in recent decades. In agriculture, they have changed farming practices by offering farmers substantial cost savings, increased operational efficiency, and better profitability. Over the past decades, the topic of agricultural drones has attracted remarkable academic attention. We therefore conduct a comprehensive review based on bibliometrics to summarize and structure existing academic literature and reveal current research trends and hotspots. We apply bibliometric techniques and analyze the literature surrounding agricultural drones to summarize and assess previous research. Our analysis indicates that remote sensing, precision agriculture, deep learning, machine learning, and the Internet of Things are critical topics related to agricultural drones. The co-citation analysis reveals six broad research clusters in the literature. This study is one of the first attempts to summarize drone research in agriculture and suggest future research directions.},

  abstract = {Given A≔{a1,…,am}⊂Rd whose affine hull is Rd, we study the problems of computing an approximate rounding of the convex hull of A and an approximation to the minimum-volume enclosing ellipsoid of A. In the case of centrally symmetric sets, we first establish that Khachiyan's barycentric coordinate descent (BCD) method is exactly the polar of the deepest cut ellipsoid method using two-sided symmetric cuts. This observation gives further insight into the efficient implementation of the BCD method. We then propose a variant algorithm which computes an approximate rounding of the convex hull of A, and which can also be used to compute an approximation to the minimum-volume enclosing ellipsoid of A. Our algorithm is a modification of the algorithm of Kumar and Yıldırım, which combines Khachiyan's BCD method with a simple initialization scheme to achieve a slightly improved polynomial complexity result, and which returns a small “core set.” We establish that our algorithm computes an approximate solution to the dual optimization formulation of the minimum-volume enclosing ellipsoid problem that satisfies a more complete set of approximate optimality conditions than either of the two previous algorithms. Furthermore, this added benefit is achieved without any increase in the improved asymptotic complexity bound of the algorithm of Kumar and Yıldırım or any increase in the bound on the size of the computed core set. In addition, the “dropping idea” used in our algorithm has the potential of computing smaller core sets in practice. We also discuss several possible variants of this dropping technique.},

  abstract  = {Context: Software developers face complex, connected, and large software projects. The development of such systems involves design decisions that directly impact the quality of the software. For an early decision making, software developers can use model-based prediction approaches for (non-)functional quality properties. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these approaches is challenged by newly introduced hardware features like multiple cores within a single CPU (multicores) and their dependence on shared memory and other shared resources. Objectives: Our goal is to understand whether and how existing model-based performance prediction approaches face this challenge. We plan to use gained insights as foundation for enriching existing prediction approaches with capabilities to predict systems running on multicores. Methods: We perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify current model-based prediction approaches in the context of multicores. Results: Our SLR covers the software engineering, embedded systems, High Performance Computing, and Software Performance Engineering domains for which we examined 34 sources in detail. We found various performance prediction approaches which tries to increase prediction accuracy for multicore systems by including shared memory designs to the prediction models. Conclusion: However, our results show that the memory designs models are only in an initial phase. Further research has to be done to improve cache, memory, and memory bandwidth model as well as to include auto tuner support.},
